                <h3>*        Firstly, FAQ pages can bring new visitors to your website via organic search and drive them quickly to related pages â€“ most typically deeper blog pages and service pages 
                    closely related to the questions being resolved. Next, one of the most significant opportunities for impactful brand visibility within the search engine result pages 
                    (in-SERP) is targeting audience questions, wants, needs, and pain points.The FAQ page is one of the best ways to help people visit your site and get snippets of answers
                    in front of users before they click any results within the search pages.A helpful FAQ page (more likely an FAQ hub of core pages and topical intent) shortens the time it
                    takes for people to solve their search requirements.</h3>

                    <h3>The experience from the first visit to conversion is also faster because you remove any possible barriers to knowledge (informational and often trust).</h3>
<br></br>
<h3>As a company, you are showcasing expertise through FAQs, plus introducing your key staff, knowledge, and unique insights into the industry sooner.</h3>

<h3>You add credibility and value through meaningful content in the many forms your audience requires. This will typically include audio, visual/video, and layering of content types now, compared to traditional text-only content provision.</h3>
    <br></br>

<h3>You are also servicing the need for offline conversation and experience through faster and always available online mechanisms.
People will always seek help and advice. They are unwilling to pick up the phone, walk into a store, or wait hours (even minutes) for that information or insight to become accessible.</h3>
