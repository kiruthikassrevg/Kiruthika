            <h3>
            Organic farming is the key factor to protect the earth's resources sustainably. To utilize
            earth's natural resources in such a way to avoid damage to nature and these resources must be available
            for our next generation, is a sustainable approach. We are living in an era where we must have to use those
            methods and techniques through which we can save our planet earth and the only way is organic farming.

            <center><h2>Organic cereals</h2></center>
            <h3>A cereal is any grass cultivated for its edible grain (botanically, a type of fruit called a caryopsis),
                which is composed of an endosperm, a germ, and a bran. Cereal grain crops are grown in greater quantities
                and provide more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop[1] and are therefore staple crops. They
                include rice, wheat, rye, oats, barley, millet, and maize. Edible grains from other plant families, such as buckwheat,
                quinoa, and chia, are referred to as pseudocereals.</h3>
